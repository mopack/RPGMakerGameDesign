## Designers

This is my first handmade PC-Game.

I made this game when i was in NTU, with other classmates, in a class called 《校園資產詮釋計畫》(National Taiwan University Heritage Interpretations).  

They are 莊岳祥、上官良治、堀江賢一、張瀞婷、吳致緯、李修甫、廖炳閎、郭志豪、張斐昕、陳映蓉、謝佳倫.  

I had done most of the RPG Maker's design. Other classmates made most of the photos and a theme song.
